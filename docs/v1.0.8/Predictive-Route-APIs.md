# Predictive Routing APIs

## [Predictive Routing API]()

Calculate optimal routes between two or more specified locations. Support live and predictive traffic to calculate ETAs based on arrival or departure time.
#### Java
~~~java  
MapplsPredictiveDirections mapplsPredictiveDirections = MapplsPredictiveDirections.builder() 
	 .origin(startPoint)
	 .destination(destinationPoint)
	 .build();  
	 //To call in foreground Thread
MapplsPredictiveDirectionManager.newInstance(mapplsPredictiveDirections).call(new OnResponseCallback<PredictiveDirectionsResponse>() {
	@Override  
	public void onSuccess(PredictiveDirectionsResponse response) {  
		 //Handle Response      
	}  
  
	@Override  
	public void onError(int code, String message) {  
	 //Handle Error      
	}  
 });
			//OR
			//To call in background Thread
 PredictiveDirectionsResponse response = MapplsPredictiveDirectionManager.newInstance(mapplsPredictiveDirections).execute(); 
 ~~~  

#### Kotlin
~~~kotlin  
val mapplsPredictiveDirections = MapplsPredictiveDirections.builder()  
      .origin(startPoint)
      .destination(destinationPoint)
      .build()  
	  //To call in foreground thread
MapplsPredictiveDirectionManager.newInstance(mapplsPredictiveDirections).call(object : OnResponseCallback<PredictiveDirectionsResponse> {  
	 override fun onSuccess(response: PredictiveDirectionsResponse) {
	    //handle response 
	 }
	 override fun onError(code: Int, message: String) {
	  //handle Error 
	 }
})  
			//OR
			//To call in background Thread
val response = MapplsPredictiveDirectionManager.newInstance(mapplsPredictiveDirections).execute() 
~~~  
### Request Parameters
#### Mandatory Parameter
1. `origin(Point)`: pass the origin point
	- origin can also takes *mappls pin* in parameter eg., `origin("17ZUL7")`
2. `destination(Point)`: pass the destination point
	- destination can also takes *mappls pin* in parameter eg., `destination("MMI000")`
#### Optional Parameter
1. `profile(String)`: Profile for routing engine. **Below are the available profile:**
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PROFILE_DRIVING` **(Default)**:Meant for car routing
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PROFILE_BIKING`:Meant for two-wheeler routing.
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PROFILE_WALKING`:  Meant for pedestrian and hiking routing. This profile shows the shortest path by using sidewalks and trails.
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PROFILE_TRUCKING`: Meant for Truck routing.
2. `speedType(MapplsDirectionSpeedType)`: To specify the type of speed. **Below are the available speed types:**
- `new MapplsDirectionSpeedTypeOptimal()`**(Default)**
- `new MapplsDirectionSpeedTypeTraffic()`
- `new MapplsDirectionSpeedTypePredictive(MapplsDirectionDateTime)`  
  _If value is predictive then date and time are required at the location and if value is optimal then date and time are not required._

- `new MapplsDirectionDateTimeCurrent()`: Current departure time.
	- `new MapplsDirectionDateTimeSpecified(PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.SPECIFIED_DEPARTURE, timeInMillis)`: Specified departure time.
	- `new MapplsDirectionDateTimeSpecified(PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.SPECIFIED_ARRIVAL, timeInMillis)`: Specified arrival time.
3. `heading(Integer)`: Preferred direction of travel for the start from the location. This can be useful for mobile routing where a vehicle is traveling in a specific direction along a road, and the route should start in that direction. The heading is indicated in degrees from north in a clockwise direction, where north is 0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°._`(ex.heading(100))`_
4. `headingTolerance(Integer)`: How close in degrees a given street's angle must be in order for it to be considered as in the same direction of the heading parameter. The default value is 60 degrees. _`(ex.heading(45).headingTolerance(45))`_
5. `preferredSide(String)`: If the location is not offset from the road centerline or is closest to an intersection this option has no effect. Otherwise the determined side of street is used to determine whether or not the location should be visited from the same, opposite or either side of the road with respect to the side of the road the given locale drives on. In Germany (driving on the right side of the road), passing a value of same will only allow you to leave from or arrive at a location such that the location will be on your right. In Australia (driving on the left side of the road), passing a value of same will force the location to be on your left. A value of opposite will enforce arriving/departing from a location on the opposite side of the road from that which you would be driving on while a value of either will make no attempt limit the side of street that is available for the route.* **Below are the available values:**
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PREFERRED_SIDE_SAME`
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PREFERRED_SIDE_EITHER`
	- `PredictiveDirectionsCriteria.PREFERRED_SIDE_OPPOSITE`
6. `searchCutoff(Integer)`: The cutoff at which we will assume the input is too far away from civilisation to be worth correlating to the nearest graph elements.
7. `avoidLocations(Point...)`: A set of locations to exclude or avoid within a route can be specified using a JSON array of avoid_locations. The avoid_locations have the same format as the locations list. At a minimum each avoid location must include latitude and longitude. The avoid_locations are mapped to the closest road or roads and these roads are excluded from the route path computation.Any route formed on the avoid_locations will return an alternative route and if no alternative is found then "no route" is returned.
8. `avoidPolygons(Point...)`: One or multiple exterior rings of polygons in the form of nested JSON arrays, e.g. [[[lon1, lat1], [lon2,lat2]],[[lon1,lat1],[lon2,lat2]]]. Roads intersecting these rings will be avoided during path finding. If you only need to avoid a few specific roads, it's much more efficient to use avoid_locations. API will close open rings (i.e. copy the first coordinate to the last position).
9. `routeName(String)`: Name your route request. If id is specified, the naming will be sent thru to the response._`(ex.id(MapmyIndia))`_
10. `useFerry(Double)`: 1.  This value indicates the willingness to take ferries. This is a range of values between 0 and 1. Values near 0 attempt to avoid ferries and values near 1 will favor ferries. The default value is 0.5. Note that sometimes ferries are required to complete a route so values of 0 are not guaranteed to avoid ferries entirely._`(ex.useFerry(0))`_
11. `useHighway(Double)`: This value indicates the willingness to take highways. This is a range of values between 0 and 1. Values near 0 attempt to avoid highways and values near 1 will favor highways. The default value is 1.0. Note that sometimes highways are required to complete a route so values of 0 are not guaranteed to avoid highways entirely._`(ex.use_highways(0))`_
12. `excludeTunnel(Boolean)`: whether to exclude roads marked as tunnels.
13. `excludeBridge(Boolean)`: whether to exclude roads marked as bridges.
14. `avoidTolls(Boolean)`: This value indicates the willingness to take roads with tolls. This is a range of values true and false. Values true attempt to avoid tolls and values false will not attempt to avoid them.
15. `alternatives(Integer)`: A number denoting how many alternate routes should be provided. There may be no alternates or less alternates than the user specifies. Alternates are not yet supported on multipoint routes (that is, routes with more than 2 locations).

The following options are available for truck profile:
~~~  
- height(Double)  - The height of the truck (in meters).  
- width(Double)  - The width of the truck (in meters).  
- length(Double)  - The length of the truck (in meters). Default is 21.64.  
- weight(Double)  - The weight of the truck (in metric tons). Default is 21.77.  
- axleLoad(Double)  - The axle load of the truck (in metric tons). Default is 9.07.

## [Predictive Distance]()

This service computes time and distance between a set of locations and returns them to you in the resulting matrix table.

The distance can return a row matrix, a column matrix, or a general matrix of computed time and distance, depending on your input for the source and target parameters. The general case is a row ordered matrix with the time and distance from each source location to each target location. A row vector is considered a one_to_many distance-time matrix where there is one source location and multiple target locations, time and distance from the source location to all target locations is returned. A column matrix represents a many_to_one distance-time matrix where there are many sources and one target. Another special case is when the source location list is the same as the target location list. API also supports many_to_many distance-time matrix, this special case is often used as the input to optimized routing problems.
